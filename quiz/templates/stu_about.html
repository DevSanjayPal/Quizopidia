        Main purpose of the proposed system is to implement the test module for the students to test their skills such as aptitude and Numeracy for the behaviour and decision-making capacity, as well as literacy test. This system also utilizes the various parameters such as attendance of the student, CGPA score or percentage of the final result given by the faculty members to the students. Proposed system is designed to utilize all parameters as well as scores to generate the one single score for each student.

        When it comes to hiring new staff, many CEOs and HR professionals have a misguided belief about the benefit of employing thorough assessments to accomplish such as, Screening applicants for conscientiousness rather than intellect will result in superior outcomes, Assessing for morals rather than intellect will produce better performance when it comes to hiring, Applicants misrepresent themselves on these types of tests, hence they are of little use, Candidates' candidacies can be better assessed through unstructured interviews than through more formal methods of assessment etc.

        Proposed system mainly consists two actors, one is student and other is admin. Admin is responsible to set the various tests such as Numeracy, aptitude, literacy etc. . On the other hand, student is able to login with the help of the email id as well as the Enrollment number which will be verified by the system by comparing it with the database of the student. Proposed system is using the dummy database of the students rather than using API connection with the database of the university.
